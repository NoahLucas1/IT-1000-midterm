### Friends can be a huge part of a lot of people's lives, I know for me that is the case!

Me personally, I have had a lot of friends over the years as I've grown up into me becoming an adult. Some really good friends, and others that I am okay with letting go. I'm glad that I've made a lot of new friends with me starting college too!
Some friend that I have right now is Quincy and Logan! These are both some really great freinds that I have made in college that are always there for me watch out for me - as well as me for them.

import math
while (True):
    try:
        r=float(input("enter radius of a cylinder" ))
    except ValueError:
        print("only positive numerical characters allowed")
    else:
        break
while (True):
    try:
        h=float(input("enter height of a cylinder" ))
    except ValueError:
        print("Only positive numerical characters allowed")
    else:
            break
A = 2*math.pi*r*h+2*math.pi*r*r

print("the volume of a cylinder will be %.2f" %volume)
