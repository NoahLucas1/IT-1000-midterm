### Traveling Around? I Need More Money!

Traveling around has been a big passions of my family's for a long time. Every summer, as long as we are able to we always try and go somewhere. A lot of times we usually go to Branson, MO and go to the theme park Silver Dollar City. My parents also have a house at the Lake of the Ozars and during the summer.

I personally have been out of the United States three times! I have been to Mexico twice and Jamaica once.
